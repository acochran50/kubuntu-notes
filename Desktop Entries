Desktop entries for applications that don't create them on install seem to be most usually (and usefully) put in:

  /usr/share/applications/FILENAME.desktop

The general recipe for creating desktop entries is as follows:

  [Desktop Entry]
  Version=1.0
  Type=Application
  Name=Foo Viewer
  Comment=The best viewer for Foo objects available!
  TryExec=fooview
  Exec=fooview %F
  Icon=fooview
  MimeType=image/x-foo;
  Actions=Gallery;Create;

  [Desktop Action Gallery]
  Exec=fooview --gallery
  Name=Browse Gallery

  [Desktop Action Create]
  Exec=fooview --create-new
  Name=Create a new Foo!
  Icon=fooview-new
